# General steps to installing a new app

1. Clone the GitHub repo
2. Create your discovery service instance.
3. Connect your instance to your app.  
4. Test your app locally
5. Deploy your app to bluemix

# Example 1 - Discovery News

Install homebrew 
- /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Clone the GitHub repo

0. Copy zip file to location on your machine
- https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/discovery-starter-kit

Create your discovery service instance.

0. Create discovery service instance via tooling

Orâ€¦
1. Install Cloud foundry {for WDS environ set up and deployment} 
- brew install cloudfoundry/tap/cf-cli
2. Login to bluemix
- cf login -u {email} --sso
{supply the one time key to log in}
3. Create discovery service and credentials using cloud foundry
- cf create-service discovery standard Discovery-Demo
- cf create-service-key Discovery-Demo myKey
- cf service-key Discovery-Demo myKey

Connect your instance to your app.  
0. Copy the example .env to .env and modify it with your discovery service credentials using editor
{consider adding .env to get ignore if cloning to Github}

Test your app locally
1. Install X code {Mac, install from Apple app store}
2. Install Node.js 
- brew node install
3. Start server locally 
{cd to root of local directory}
- npm install
- npm start
4. Review app on port 3000

Deploy your app to bluemix (not covered)

0. Compile production app
1. Use cloud foundry to deploy app to bluemix

https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-cf.html#cloud-foundry-command-line-interface

# Example 2 - Voice of the customer (app works best in Google Chrome)

1. Clone the GitHub repo

0. Copy zip file to location on your machine
- https://github.ibm.com/psmoraes/voc-discovery

2. Create your discovery service instance.

0. Create discovery service collection via tooling
1. Create the collection voc_config
2. Retrieve the username and password credentials from the service details page.
3. Retrieve the environment id and collection id from the URL by running ann empty query.

https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/discovery/api/v1/environments/358028e7-2263-4511-9be4-34f76bdf78ed/collections/eced038e-fc2e-464c-90c3-1dd2c52105df/query?version=2017-10-16&count=&offset=&aggregation=&filter=&passages=true&deduplicate=false&highlight=true&return=&query=

Information needed:
username
password
environment id
collection id
discovery_config.json from root level of repository


4. Open a terminal, cd to the root folder for VOC and use the curl command with the above information to upload the new configuration from the downloaded repository. Information in {} denotes variables.

    curl -X POST \
    -u "{username}":"{password}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d @discovery_config.json "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/discovery/api/v1/environments/{environment_id}/configurations?version=2016-12-01"



3. Connect your instance to your app.

4. Test your app locally

5. Deploy your app to bluemix (not covered)
