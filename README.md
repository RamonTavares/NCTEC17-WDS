# General steps to installing a new app

1. Clone the GitHub repo
2. Create your discovery service instance.
3. Connect your instance to your app.  
4. Test your app locally
5. Deploy your app to bluemix (not covered)

# Example 1 - Discovery News

Install homebrew (For Mac, needed to install node.js if you did not download from Web)
- /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Clone the GitHub repo (Can be done with Git or by grabbing the zip)

0. Copy zip file to location on your machine
- https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/starter-kits.html#news-intelligence

Create your discovery service instance. (Only needs to be done once.)

0. Create discovery service instance via tooling

Orâ€¦
1. Install Cloud foundry {for WDS environ set up and deployment} 
- brew install cloudfoundry/tap/cf-cli
2. Login to bluemix
- cf login -u {email} --sso
{supply the one time key to log in}
3. Create discovery service and credentials using cloud foundry
- cf create-service discovery lite Discovery-Demo
- cf create-service-key Discovery-Demo myKey
- cf service-key Discovery-Demo myKey

Connect your instance to your app.  Open a text editor (vi, emacs, notepad++...) to edit the .env.example file. 
0. Copy the example .env to .env and modify it with your discovery service credentials using editor
{consider adding .env to get ignore if cloning to Github}

username ="{username}"
password="{password}"
environment_id="system"
collection_id="news"

Test your app locally
1. Install X code {Mac, install from Apple app store, needed as requirement for cloudfoundry, if not using cloudfoundry then skip}
2. Install Node.js 
- brew node install

3. Start server locally 
{cd to root of local directory}
- npm install
- npm start
4. Review app on port 3000

Deploy your app to bluemix (not covered)

0. Compile production app
1. Use cloud foundry to deploy app to bluemix

https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-cf.html#cloud-foundry-command-line-interface

# Example 2 - Voice of the customer (app works best in Google Chrome)

Clone the GitHub repo

0. Copy zip file to location on your machine
- https://github.ibm.com/psmoraes/voc-discovery <- (this app does not work out of the box and needs additional configuration)

Create your discovery service instance.

0. Create discovery service collection via tooling
1. Create the collection voc_config
2. Upload the configuration from the NC TEC repository.

Note: The configuration provided in the repo needs to be updated to use Natural Language Understanding.
discovery_config in the download folder is a configuration for Alchemy Language. A new configuration needs to be created that uses Natural Language Understanding enrichments, this configuration is discovery_config2.json

To upload the existing configuration from the collection:
Retrieve the username and password credentials from the service details page.
Retrieve the environment id and collection id from the URL by running an empty query. Look for the hash after the environments/ to retrieve the environment id.

https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/discovery/api/v1/environments/358028e7-2263-4511-9be4-34f76bdf78ed/collections/eced038e-fc2e-464c-90c3-1dd2c52105df/query?version=2017-10-16&count=&offset=&aggregation=&filter=&passages=true&deduplicate=false&highlight=true&return=&query=

Information needed:
username
password
environment id
discovery_config2.json from the NC TEC repository (not VOC)

Open a terminal, cd to the root folder for VOC and use the curl command with the above information to upload the new configuration from the downloaded repository. Information in {} denotes variables.

    curl -X POST \
    -u "{username}":"{password}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d @discovery_config2.json "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/discovery/api/v1/environments/{environment_id}/configurations?version=2017-10-16"

The command above sends the new NLU configuration to your collection

Once you have uploaded the configuration you may need to reload your browser to see the new configuration.
Next to Default configuration select edit to change your configuration to the new configuration you just uploaded, voc-config-new.

Apply the configuration to the collection. Add any remaining enrichments to review_text.

Note: In order to see data in visualizations for the tooling switch to the 
convert tab. Select copy add the field review_text in the first box, add text to the second box.

Once the configuration has been applied properly you can ingest your data using the tooling.
Load data to your app by dragging data from the discovery-documents folder in voc-discovery-master folder to your WDS instance.

Connect your instance to your app.

To connect the node.js app to your instance you will need a .env file.

0. Copy the .env.example file to .env

Supply the following information:
username
password
environment id
collection id

Same format as Example 1

There are slight differences with the app since we applied a new configuration.
The constants.ts file needs to be updated to supply the appropriate constants in order for the product search to function properly.

Replace the existing constants.ts file with the file in the NC TEC repository
src/app/shared/constants.ts

Test your app locally

npm install
npm start

This time you may need to start your browser manually and navigate to http://localhost:3000

Review the app in your web browser

Explore the node.js app, additional configuration needs to happen in order for the enrichment visualizer page to work. See if you can figure out what changes need to happen.

Deploy your app to bluemix (not covered)

See the above instructions for the previous demo
